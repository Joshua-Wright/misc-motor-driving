# encoders

## quadrature encoders
or, rather, incremental encoders with quadrature signal output.

Wikipedia has some useful information for implementing a decoder:

# Brushed DC motors

there's some good looking encoder gearmotors on amazon for relatively cheap:

# Brushless DC Motors

these are now super cheap, thanks to hobby drones. But can such motors do decent torque? and can they be driven with an arduino, or do I need to buy an odrive?
